The project focusing on employees' safe return to the office amidst the pandemic. Our team implemented a machine learning pipeline for risk assessment involves several key steps. Firstly, we start with data collection, sourcing relevant information related to the risk factors we want to evaluate.The following risk factor we consider in order to build a dummy data -
(Company's Location	Age	Gender	Residence	Commute mode	Shift	Office Structure	Travel history(in past 30 days)	Current Disease	Current infected	Previously infected	Dependent(Senior Citizen/Infant)	Dependent's disease	Dependent infected currently	Vaccine Status	Fitness Level) and to make it a supervised model, we manually assigned infection rate based on threshold values of each feature.


1. Data Pre-processing: This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and performing feature engineering. We aim to transform raw data into a format that's suitable for the machine learning model. This might involve techniques like normalization and one-hot encoding.

2. Model Selection: Depending on the nature of the risk assessment, we choose regression model to predict the risk score and applied various ML Algorithm.

3. Train and evaulate- we train the model on a subset of the data and validate its performance. This is crucial for ensuring the model is capable of accurately predicting risk. We use techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to fine-tune the model's performance. By leveraging machine learning with XGBoost, we achieved an impressive 93% accuracy. 

Once the model is trained and validated, we move it into production. This involves setting up a system where new data can be fed into the model to make real-time risk assessments. It's important to continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain it as needed to adapt to changing conditions or data patterns. Additionally, I used Tableau to create visually compelling dashboards, identifying critical risk factors.
